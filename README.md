This project implements an AI-powered chatbot for handling customer support queries. The chatbot is built using Hugging Face's GPT-2 model and deployed via Gradio for a user-friendly web interface. The chatbot can generate relevant and context-aware responses to common customer inquiries such as product details, order tracking, return policies, and more.

Key Features:

Built using Hugging Face Transformers for text generation.
Gradio for creating an easy-to-use interactive interface.
Real-time customer support via chatbot interactions.
Tools and Technologies:

Python: The core programming language used in this project.
Hugging Face Transformers: Pre-trained models (like GPT-2) are used to generate responses based on customer input.
Gradio: For creating the web-based interface for easy user interaction.
PyTorch: For model deployment and inference.
